# My-Simple-Game

Provided waste bins taking in junk of diffeerent types (ie. plastic, organic, liquid wastes), when trash is thrown into the appropriate bin, points will be awarded and a new junk will be generated immediately at random. If there is not enough space in a waste bin to accommodate the junk to be added, the junk will not be added to the waste bin thus will need to be emptied before the new junk can be added. A waste bin must be at least 75% full before it can be emptied, otherwise no action will be taken when the "Empty" button is pressed.
